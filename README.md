# Molecular Set Transformer
A deep learning model, namely Molecular Set Transformer, was designed for enabling high-throughput co-crystal screening for any type of molecular pairs. The model is able to provide score and uncertainty for any given molecular pair based on its probability to form a multicomponent crystal.

# Installation
We recommend installing the package by following the instructions below.
```
conda create --name cocrystals python=3.8.8
conda activate cocrystals
git clone https://github.com/lrcfmd/MolecularSetTransformer.git
cd MolecularSetTransformer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or cloning the environment from the cocrystals.yaml file
```
conda create --name myclone --clone cocrystals.yml
```

# Extract co-crystals from the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)
You need the CSD licence (https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/) to use this script. You can extract multicomponent crystals after screening the whole > 1 million CSD database. If you do not want to include the solvents , you can use the option  `--no_solvents`

    python extract_cocrystals/extract_cocrystals.py --no_solvents

Our extracted csd co-crystals dataset using CSD 2020 can be found in `csd_data/csd_cocrystals2020.csv`
The training co-crystals dataset was created after removing the duplicate pairs, i.e., pairs found both in the csd_cocrystals2020 and in the benchmark data and is referred as `csd_data/csd_training_set.csv`

    python extract_cocrystals/drop_duplicates.py

The code for generating the co-crystals tree map can be found in the ```TMAP-cocrystals``` folder. The PPD code for calculating the distances between the co-crystals can be found in https://github.com/dwiddo/average-minimum-distance

# Benchmarks (Publically available co-crystal screening data)
All the is-silico co-crystal screening datasets gathered from literature can be found on the validation_database folder and are described below in chronological order:

# Train your own models based on the prefered molecular representation

    python train.py --model <model> --training_data <data> --save_dir <save_dir> -n_epochs <epochs> -lr <learning_rate>

- `model` The molecular embeddings to use. Choose among:
    - gnn
    - morgan
    - chemberta
    - mordred
- `training_data` The location of the .csv file containing the molecular pairs for training
- `save_dir` The directory to save the trained model 
- `n_epochs` The number of epochs to use for training    
- `lr` Learning rate
- `use wandb` We use Weight&Biases to monitor the hyperparameters during the training. This not a strict requirement but it is suggested. If you want to use it, you need to use the 'use_wandb' flag and to create an account [here](https://wandb.ai/) and install the Python package:

    ```  
    pip install wandb
    ```

Example

    python train.py --model gnn --training_data csd_data/csd_cocrystals2020.csv --save_dir pretrained_models --model_name gnn_trained -n_epochs 10 -lr 0.001 --use_wandb

# Load a model after training

```
from load_pretrained_models import *
gnn_model = load_model('gnn', 'pretrained_models/model.pth')
```
